The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes



## Advice to translators

It is totally legitimate to emply technology to assist in your translation. To
do otherwise would be to deny reality. HOWEVER do take care to go sentence by
sentence and review in both directions to ensure that your selection of tone,
voice, vocabulary and tense are all true to the story - Many automated tools
fail to read and render context appropriately, so your translation may end up
feeling flat, excessively terse or verbose, or even entirely bizarre. Use
multiple tools and be sure to canvas the opinions of real humans if you have
doubts.

Do NOT just throw an entire story into ChatGPT or Google Translate and expect a
sensitive rendering of the text.

Bear in mind that Holmes, Watson and other characters exist in Victorian
England, and often speak rather formally even when in what we may consider
familiar circumstances. Other characters may speak more colloquially or
familiarly, and this often tallies with their status within the story and, more
broadly, Victorian society. Take advantage of _chi'n erbyn ti_ to add to the
feel of the story.
